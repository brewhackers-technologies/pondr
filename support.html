          Who can read and write on Pondr?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently writing on Pondr is under private beta and we are open for
        people to join our beta program. We will stop taking new admissions once
        we reach 1000 users with access to write. We are trying to get
        like-minded people who are interested in business, startups, technology,
        personal growth and entrepreneurship to write on our platform.
      </p>
      <p>Reading on Pondr is accessible to all.</p>

          What can I write about?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can write about anything interesting and intriguing. However,
        content related to personal growth, entrepreneurship, startups,
        technology will get more distribution at this point.
      </p>

          Who sees my content?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your content is public and anyone with the app can see all the content
        you publish.
      </p>

      <!-- ///////////////// -->
      <p>
        <strong>
          How is my content distributed?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, we are testing out multiple algorithms to figure out the most
        optimum way for content to reach relevant user. As we test it, for a
        limited time, the content is distributed chronologically, that is newest
        first. Our initial users can make the most of it while this is the case
        as they will get instant distribution on the homepage as soon as they
        publish the articles.
      </p>
