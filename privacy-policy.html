          <p></p>
        </ol>
        <br/>

        <p><b>SERVICE PROVIDERS:</b></p>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and Individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To facilitate our service</li>
          <li>To provide service on our behalf</li>
          <li>To perform service related services</li>
          <li>To assist us in analyzing how our service is used</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>

        <p><b>THIRD-PARTY EMBEDS</b></p>
        <p>
          Pondr does not host some of the content displayed on our Services. Users have the 
          ability to post content that is actually hosted by a third party, but is embedded 
          in our pages (an <i><b>“Embed”</b></i>). When you interact with an Embed, it can 
          send information about your interaction to the hosting third party just as if you 
          were visiting the third party’s site directly. For example, when you load a Pondr 
          post page with a YouTube video Embed and watch the video, YouTube receives 
          information about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video
          you watch. Pondr does not control what information third parties collect through 
          Embeds or what they do with the information. This Privacy Policy does not apply 
          to information collected through Embeds. The privacy policy belonging to the third 
          party hosting the Embed applies to any information the Embed collects, and we 
          recommend you review that policy before interacting with the Embed. We are not 
          responsible for the practices of such third parties, whose information practices 
          are subject to their own policies and procedures, not to this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p><b>PROMOTE SAFETY, INTEGRITY AND SECURITY</b></p>
        <p>
          We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful 
          conduct, detect and prevent bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our 
          Products, and promote safety and security on and off of Pondr. For example, 
          we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p><b>PROTECTION OF INFORMATION</b></p>
        <p>
          The security of your information is important to us. Pondr has implemented 
          safeguards to protect the information we collect. However, no website or 
          Internet transmission is completely secure. We urge you to take steps to keep 
          your personal information safe, such as choosing a strong password and keeping 
          it private, as well as logging out of your user account on a shared or unsecured device.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Access and amend your information:</b> You may update or correct your account 
            information at any time by logging in to your account. You may also make a number of 
            other adjustments to settings or the display of information about you.
          </li>
          <p></p>

          <li>
            <b>Your Content:</b> You may edit or delete your posts at any time. Any deleted 
            content will be removed from third-party sites from which it has been shared via 
            Pondr’s standard sharing features; however, we have no control over deletions or 
            changes to your content
          </li>

          </li>
          <p></p>

          <li>
            <b>Linked Networks:</b> You may connect or disconnect your Linked Networks, such as Google, 
            through the Account Settings tab in your profile settings, and you may access, 
            amend and delete much of your profile information through your profile settings. 
            Once you disconnect a Linked Network, we will not receive information from that 
            Linked Network going forward unless you choose to reconnect it. You may also control
            whether the Linked Network is visible in your profile and, if you enable contact 
            imports, how you message your contacts to find and connect with you on Pondr. if it 
            has been shared manually by others.

        <p><b>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</b></p>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the 
          age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If we become aware that we 
          have collected personal information from a child under the relevant age without 
          parental consent, we take steps to delete that information. If you’re a parent or 
          guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information,
          please contact us so that we can accordingly delete it from our servers.
