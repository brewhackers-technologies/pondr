        PONDR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES
      </div>
      <p>
        We want Pondr to continue to be a safe place for inspiration 
        and expression. Our Community Guidelines set out our policies 
        for what we do and don’t allow on Pondr in order to achieve 
        this. We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us 
        foster and protect this amazing community. By using Pondr, 
        you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. Overstepping 
        these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, 
        or other restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would 
        otherwise go against our Community Guidelines – if it is newsworthy 
        and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the 
        public interest value against the risk of harm and we look to 
        international human rights standards to make these judgments. 
        Anyone can write a post on Pondr, as long as it’s not in 
        violation of our guidelines.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p><b>OUR GUIDELINES</b></p>
      <p>
        We welcome thoughtful and civil discussion from a broad spectrum of viewpoints.
        Nevertheless, to maintain a safe and welcoming environment for a wide range of 
        people to engage in meaningful conversations, we prohibit certain conduct.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Share content and pictures that you’ve taken or have the right to share:</b> 
          As always, you own the content you post on Pondr. Remember to post authentic 
          content, and don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the 
          Internet that you don’t have the right to post. Unless you’re authorized 
          to use someone else’s copyrighted work or trademark (either expressly or 
          by legal exceptions and limitations like fair use), don’t do it.
        </li>
        <p></p>

        <li>
          <b>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions:</b> Help us stay spam-free by not 
          artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive 
          comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial 
          purposes without their consent. Don’t offer money in exchange for likes, 
          followers, comments or other engagement. Don’t post content that engages 
          in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits to the offering, 
          solicitation or trade of fake and misleading user reviews or ratings. 
          All spam will be immediately removed from Pondr, without notification. 
          While it is hard to define this content with precision or completeness, 
          here are some representative behaviours we look for that are characteristic 
          of spam:
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Scraping and reposting content from other sources for the primary purpose 
              of generating revenue or other personal gains
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
              Posting duplicate content, whether from a single account or across multiple accounts
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
              Stories where the content is clipped with the sole purpose of linking to the rest 
              of the article on a different website
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
              Performing a disproportionately large number of interactions, particularly 
              by automated means. This includes bulk, indiscriminate interactions, 
              such as following of other accounts (follow spam).
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
              Repeatedly using responses or other interactions as a method of promotion
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
              Participating in bounty campaigns or brigades to artificially inflate 
              rankings for posts and accounts.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
              Use or re-use content templates with slight modifications across 
              multiple posts and accounts
            </li>
            <p></p>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Don’t impersonate others or provide inaccurate information</b> You don’t 
          have to use your real name on Pondr, but we do require Pondr users 
          to provide us with accurate and up to date information. Don't 
          impersonate others and don't create accounts for the purpose of 
          violating our guidelines or misleading others.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>Post content and pictures that are appropriate for a diverse audience:</b> 
          We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images 
          along with their content that are artistic or creative in nature, but for 
          a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Pondr. This includes 
          pictures and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, 
          genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some 
          pictures of female/male nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring 
          are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is acceptable, too. 
          People like to share photos of their children. For safety reasons, there 
          are times when we may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. 
          Even when this content is shared with good intentions, it could be used by 
          others in unanticipated ways.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>Follow the law:</b> Pondr is not a place to support or praise terrorism, 
          organized crime, or hate groups. Offering sexual services, buying or 
          selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private individuals, 
          and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your 
          region) are also not allowed. Pondr also prohibits the sale of live animals 
          between private individuals, though brick-and-mortar stores may offer these 
          sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered species or 
          their parts. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy 
          other regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money 
          games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior written permission 
          before using any of our products. We have zero tolerance when it comes to 
          sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to post intimate 
          images of others.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury: </b>
          The Pondr community cares for each other, and is often a place where 
          people facing difficult issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or 
          other kinds of self- injury come together to create awareness or find 
          support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and 
          adding information so people can get the help they need. Encouraging 
          or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment 
          of support, and we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to 
          us. We may also remove content identifying victims or survivors of 
          self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humour.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events:</b> We understand that many 
          people use Pondr to share important and newsworthy events. Some of these 
          issues can involve graphic content and images. Because so many different 
          people and age groups use Pondr, we may remove content and pictures of 
          intense, graphic violence to make sure Pondr stays appropriate for everyone. 
          We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, 
          raise awareness or educate. If you do share content for these reasons, 
          we encourage you to caption your photo with a warning about graphic violence. 
          Posts without trigger warnings will be taken down immediately. Sharing 
          graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is never allowed.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>No-toleration policy for harassment and bullying:</b> We don’t tolerate harassment, 
          which includes: bullying, threatening, or shaming someone, or posting things 
          likely to encourage others to do so. It's prohibited to encourage violence 
          or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, 
          gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, 
          disabilities, or diseases. Bullying and harassment is strictly prohibited.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>Promotion and glorification of self-harm is not allowed:</b> We do not allow 
          activities that encourage, promote or glorify acts of self-harm, such as 
          cutting, eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia, and suicide. If you 
          encounter users contemplating or threatening self-harm, please report it 
          to us via the form or email address linked below.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>Any kind of Hate speech is strictly forbidden:</b> We do not allow content 
          that promotes violence or hatred against people based on characteristics 
          like race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, disease, 
          age, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity. We do not allow 
          posts or accounts that glorify, celebrate, downplay, or trivialize 
          violence, suffering, abuse, or deaths of individuals or groups. This 
          includes the use of scientific or pseudoscientific claims to pathologize, 
          dehumanize, or disempower others. We do not allow calls for intolerance, 
          exclusion, or segregation based on protected characteristics, nor do we 
          allow the glorification of groups which do any of the above. We do not 
          allow hateful text, images, symbols, or other content in your username, 
          profile, or bio.

          <p><b>Restricted categories</b></p>
          <p>
            We do not allow posts or accounts that engage in the following 
            restricted categories of activity:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Promotion of harmful conspiracies</li>
            <li>Facilitation of gambling or betting</li>
            <li>Facilitation of buying or selling social media interactions, including off-platform</li>
            <li>Facilitation of illegal sexual services</li>
            <li>Facilitation of copyright violation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <p></p>

        <li>
          <b>We do not allow deceptive conduct on Pondr:</b> This includes 
          posting content or impersonating a person or organization 
          in a way likely to deceive people. Parody and satire are 
          fine, but make clear that is what you’re doing. Using 
          Pondr for phishing or fraud. Don’t use tags, links, 
          titles, or other metadata in a misleading way. Don’t link 
          to or embed malicious or harmful code or software in your 
          posts. Don’t use deception to generate revenue or traffic.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>Respect all members of the Pondr community:</b> We want to 
          foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content 
          that contains credible threats or hate speech, content 
          that targets private individuals to degrade or shame 
          them, personal information meant to blackmail or harass 
          someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally 
          allow stronger conversation around people who are featured 
          in the news or have a large public audience due to their 
          profession or chosen activities. Serious threats of harm 
          to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This 
          includes specific threats of physical harm as well as 
          threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. 
          We carefully review reports of threats and consider many 
          things when determining whether a threat is credible.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br/>

      <p><b>HELP US KEEP THE COMMUNITY STRONG</b></p>
      <p>
        Each of us is an important part of the Pondr community. 
        If you see something that you think may violate our 
        guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting 
        option. We have a team that reviews these reports and works 
        as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t meet 
        our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t 
        have a Pondr Account, you can still file a report. When 
        you complete the report, try to provide as much information 
        as possible, such as links, usernames, and descriptions of 
        the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We may 
        remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated 
        captions violate our guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Violation of Community Guidelines:</b> We strive to be fair, 
        but we reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content, 
        without notice, for any reason, particularly to protect our 
        services, infrastructure, users, or community. If you attempt 
        to evade suspension by creating new accounts or posts, we will 
        suspend your new accounts and posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the 
        Community Guidelines. If that happens, you can unfollow or block 
        the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a 
        comment on one of your posts, you can delete that comment. Many 
        disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between 
        members of the community. If your content or pictures are posted 
        by someone else, you could try commenting on the post and asking 
        the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a 
        copyright report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, 
        you can file a trademark report. Don't target the person who 
        posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation 
        because that may be classified as harassment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that 
        there’s risk of physical harm or threat to public safety.
      </p>
