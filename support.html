          What is Pondr?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Pondr is a platform for curious people to create, consume 
        and share bite-sized shorticles on any topic of your choice. 
        It consists of eloquent short stories on diversified subjects 
        with sources for endless learnings. Our belief is that sharing 
        of ideas and experiences moves humanity forward. We want to 
        connect the people who have knowledge to the people who need it, 
        to bring together people with different perspectives so they can 
        understand each other better, and to empower everyone to share 
        their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.

        Pondr works by having the community read and write 
        bite-sized shorticles on the platform. Use your feed 
        to tell us what you're interested in reading. Your 
        feed is filled with stories that interest you. You 
        can view your feed by going to the homepage. Build 
        a good feed by following topics and people, and 
        taking actions in feed that tell us what you like.
