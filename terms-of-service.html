          Welcome to <b>Pondr!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          These <b>Terms of Use</b> (or “Terms”) govern your use of Pondr 
          (through Brewhackers Technologies Private Limited <i>collectively</i>
          ‘Pondr’, ‘we’ and ‘us’), except where we expressly state that 
          separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information 
          about the Pondr Service (the “Service”), outlined below. When 
          you create a Pondr account or use Pondr, you explicitly agree 
          to these terms of use as well as all other applicable terms and 
          policies. You can also give your consent to these terms by 
          clicking on registration options (e.g., “Continue,” “Sign-in,” or 
          “Sign-up,”) or by using our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We agree to provide you with the Pondr Service. The Service includes 
          all of the Pondr product, features, application, services, technologies, 
          and software that we provide to advance Pondr's mission: To create a 
          better version of you. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Ensuring access to our Service:</b> To operate our global Service, we must 
          store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including 
          outside of your country of residence. The use of this global 
          infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Offering personalized opportunities to create, consume, discover, 
          and share bite-sized shorticles:</b> People are different. We want 
          to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you 
          actually care about. So, we build systems that try to understand 
          who and what you and others care about, and use that information 
          to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that 
          matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, 
          and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for 
          you to experience Pondr, based on things you and others do on 
          and off Pondr.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment:</b> We 
          develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members 
          that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including 
          when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems 
          that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, 
          as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information 
          we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. 
          Learn more about this in our Privacy Policy
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Research and innovation:</b> We use the information we have to 
          study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our 
          Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p><b>TERMS OF USAGE:</b></p>

        <p>
          <b>Acceptable Usage of Pondr:</b> Providing a safe and open Service for 
          a broad community requires that we all do our part. In order to

          are considered to be misuse of Pondr and are completely prohibited:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information:</b> 
            You don't have to disclose your identity on Pondr, but you must provide 
            us with accurate and up to date information (including registration 
            information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you 
            may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't 
            create an account for someone else unless you have their express 
            permission.
          </li>
          <p></p>

          <li>
            <b>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or 
              for an illegal or unauthorized purpose (including hacking):</b> 
              You’re responsible for your use of the Service and any content 
              you provide, including compliance with applicable laws. Content 
              on the Services may be protected by others’ intellectual property 
              rights. Please don’t copy, upload, download, or share content 
              unless you have the right to do so. In case of any fraudulent 
              or illegal activity, we are authorized to take necessary action 
              against the user.
          </li>
          <p></p>

          <li>
            <b>You cannot post any scandalous and objectionable content:</b> 
            Pondr users must maintain the sanctity of the community. Any 
            objectionable content will be deleted immediately without 
            prior notice. Pondr may review your conduct and content for 
            compliance with these Terms, and reserves the right to remove 
            any violating content. All users have the right and ability to 
            report objectionable and offensive content by reporting the 
            abusive user. To foster a safe and healthy community, we will 
            be manually working on all objectionable content reports and 
            if they don’t meet our guidelines, we will be removing the 
            content within 24 hours and ejecting the user providing 
            objectionable content.
            <p><b>
              Objectionable Content: Any content that users would find to be 
              offensive, upsetting, or inappropriate amounts to objectionable content.
            </b></p>
            
            <p>
              We welcome thoughtful and civil discussion from a broad spectrum 
              of viewpoints. Nevertheless, to maintain a safe and welcoming 
              environment for a wide range of people to engage through meaningful 
              shorticles, we prohibit certain conduct.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Threats of violence and incitement:</b> We do not allow content 
                or actions that threaten, encourage, or incite violence against 
                anyone, directly or indirectly. Pondr is not a place to support 
                or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering 
                sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and 
                tobacco products between private individuals, and buying or 
                selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) 
                are also not allowed. Pondr also prohibits the sale of live animals 
                between private individuals, though brick-and-mortar stores may 
                offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of 
                endangered species or their parts. We have zero tolerance when it 
                comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening 
                to post intimate images of others.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                <b>Nudity and Sexually explicit Content:</b> We don’t allow nudity 
                on Pondr. This includes pictures and some digitally-created content 
                that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude 
                buttocks. It also includes some pictures of female/male nipples, 
                but photos of post-mastectomy scarring are allowed. Nudity in pictures 
                of paintings and sculptures are allowed.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                <b>Exploitation of minors:</b> We do not allow content promoting the 
                sexual or violent exploitation of minors, including the sexualization 
                of fictional minors.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                <b>Hate speech:</b> We do not allow content that promotes violence or 
                hatred against people based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, 
                national origin, religion, disability, disease, age, sexual orientation, 
                gender, or gender identity. We do not allow posts or accounts that glorify, 
                celebrate, downplay, or trivialize violence, suffering, abuse, or deaths 
                of individuals or groups. This includes the use of scientific or pseudoscientific 
                claims to pathologize, dehumanize, or disempower others. We do not allow calls 
                for intolerance, exclusion, or segregation based on protected characteristics, 
                nor do we allow the glorification of groups which do any of the above. We do 
                not allow hateful text, images, symbols, or other content in your username, 
                profile, or bio. We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, 
                content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal 
                information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. 
                We do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the 
                news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities. 
                When hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may 
                allow it. In those instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.

              <p></p>
              <li>
                <b>Harassment and Bullying:</b> We don’t tolerate harassment, which includes: 
                Bullying, threatening, or shaming someone, or posting things likely to encourage 
                others to do so. It's prohibited to encourage violence or attack anyone based on 
                their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual 
                orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. Bullying and harassment 
                is strictly prohibited.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                <b>Threats of Theft and Financial Harm:</b> Serious threats of harm to public and 
                personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of physical harm as 
                well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review 
                reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                <b>Promotion and glorification of self-harm:</b> We do not allow activities that 
                encourage, promote or glorify acts of self-harm, such as cutting, eating disorders 
                like anorexia or bulimia, and suicide. If you encounter users contemplating or 
                threatening self-harm, please report it to us via the form or email address linked below.

              <p></p>
              <li>
                <b>Graphic Content and Images:</b> We understand that many people use Pondr to share 
                important and newsworthy events. Some of these issues can involve graphic images. 
                Because so many different people and age groups use Pondr, we may remove pictures 
                of intense, graphic violence to make sure Pondr stays appropriate for everyone.

        <p><b>CONTENT REMOVAL AND DISABLING/TERMINATING THE ACCOUNT</b></p>
        <p>
          We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if 
          we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies 
          (including our Data Policy), or we are permitted or required to do 
          so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part 
          of the Service to you immediately to protect our community or 
          services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate 
          these Terms of Use or our policies, if you repeatedly infringe 
          other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are 
          permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or 
          change the Service, remove or block content or information shared 
          on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if 
          we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or 
          mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe 
          your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable 
          or permanently delete your account, contact us directly on 
          <a href="mailto:team@getpondr.com">team@getpondr.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion 
          process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after 
          your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after 
          the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such 
          content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to 
          other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our 
          Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to 
          another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

        <p><b>TERMS OF SERVICE:</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>Brewhackers Technologies Private Limited</b> is committed to ensuring 
          that Pondr is as useful and efficient as possible. For that 
          reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the mobile 
          application or to charge for the services, at any time and for 
          any reason. We will never charge you for Pondr. Or it’s services 
          without explicitly explaining what the user is paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should 
          remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network 
          provider will still apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pondr aims to give you great Services but there are some things 
          we can’t guarantee. Your use of our Services is at your sole 
          risk. You understand that our Services and any content posted 
          or shared by users on the Services are provided “as is” and 
          “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express 
          or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, 
          fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, Pondr doesn’t represent or warrant that our 
          Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. 
          No advice or information obtained from Pondr or through the 
          Services will create any warranty or representation not expressly 
          made in this paragraph. Pondr may provide information about 
          third-party products, services, activities or events, or we may 
          allow third parties to make their content and information available 
          on or through our Services (collectively, <i>“Third-Party Content”</i>). 
          We do not control or endorse, and we make no representations or 
          warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content. You access and use 
          Third-Party Content at your own risk. Some locations don’t allow 
          the disclaimers in this paragraph and so they might not apply to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Limitation of Liability:</b> We don’t exclude or limit our liability 
          to you where it would be illegal to do so; this includes any liability 
          for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of Pondr or 
          the other Pondr Parties in providing the Services. In countries where 
          the following types of exclusions aren’t allowed, we’re responsible to 
          you only for losses and damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result 
          of our failure to use reasonable care and skill or our breach of our 
          contract with you. This paragraph doesn’t affect consumer rights that 
          can’t be waived or limited by any contract or agreement. In countries 
          where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, Pondr and 
          its parties won’t be liable for:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, 
          or special damages, or any loss of use, data or profits, under 
          any legal theory, even if Pondr or the other Pondr Parties have 
          been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Other than for the types of liability we can’t limit by 
          law (as described in this section), we limit the total liability 
          of Pondr for any claim arising out of or relating to these 
          Terms or our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responsibility: Our Service is provided "as is," and we 
          can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work 
          perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE 
          ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
          INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS 
          FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and 
          we aren’t responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct 
          (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or 
          objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for 
          services and features offered by other people or companies, 
          even if you access them through our Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service 
          (also called "liability") is limited as much as the law 
          will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't 
          know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree 
          that we won't be responsible ("liable") for any lost profits, 
          revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, 
          indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising 
          out of or related to these Terms, even if we know they are 
          possible. This includes when we delete your content, 
          information, or account.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Termination:</b> You’re free to stop using our Services 
          at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate 
          your access to the Services with or without notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Severability:</b> If any provision or part of a provision of 
          these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that 
          provision or part of the provision is deemed severable 
          from these Terms and does not affect the validity and 
          enforceability of any remaining provisions.
        </p>
        <p><b>AMENDMENTS/UPDATES/CHANGES:</b></p>
        <p>
          We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make 
          changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our 
          Service and policies. If we make changes, we’ll provide you with 
          notice of them by sending an email to the email address associated 
          with your account, offering an in-product notification, or 
          updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless otherwise 
          required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our 
          Service) before we make changes to these Terms and give you an 
          opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if 
          you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated 
          Terms. These Terms of Usage are effective as of 04 Jan 2020.
        </p>
